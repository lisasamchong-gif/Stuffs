      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
       Hi, I’m Lisa, and this is Lisa's Stuffs. I am from Trinidad and Tobago. I am a first generation college student with one very exceptional older brother. Art and creativity has run in my family for years,
        starting when my grandfather fled China when he was 18 and ended up in the Caribbean where he started a family, but nothing truly beats home so he began to paint all the his memories
         that remained of China. My father also dreamt of being an Architect, but he had to let that go as he had 'only son' responsibilities to attend too. I always love art, sculpting especially, I liked the feeling of working with something real in my hands but as the world evolve I have realised that we are going digital and unfortunately Trinidad wasn't ready yet. So here I am in Toronto.
      </p>
